to your ear bones, via Google Play Music and Spotify.

it.

Part of the Summer of TJ™ series 2017. Volume 1: Under The Influence.
I wouldn't be who I am as an artist without any of these tracks. It's a mixed
bag of nuts, but then again so am I. These tracks not only influence me
musically but are some of my favourite get the f up jams. Keep up with the
