Two local radio stations are putting on a few on-air specials to join in The
Summer of TJ™.

CHSR 97.9 in Fredericton, New Brunswick will host a live interview with yours
truly on Tuesday, the first of August, 2017 at 12:30 PM on The Lunch Box with
Mark Kilfoil!

CIOE 97.5 in Sackville, Nova Scotia will pull double duty in The Summer of TJ™
goodness, first with an artist spotlight on Thursday, the 24th of August, 2017
at 6:00 PM on Fresh From the East Coast with Martin Hickey dealing out a handful
of tunes. Two days later, Saturday, the 26th of August, 2017 at 10:00 PM, also
on CIOE, also hosted by Martin Hickey, it's two full hours of my noises on East
Coast After Dark.

Huge thanks to both stations for their coverage and continued support!
