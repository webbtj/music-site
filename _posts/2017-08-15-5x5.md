Did it seem to you like the playlist series fell off a bit? Yeah between
vacation and being sick I did fall behind a bit, but we're going to make up for
it over the next couple of weeks starting today (Yeah, Tuesday, right?) is going
to be the first in a five part mini-series, 5x5. 5x5 playlists will feature 5
tracks from 5 different artists. The 5x5 series will roll out over the next week
or so, part 1 today, part 2 tomorrow, part 3 Thursday, part 4 next Tuesday and
part 5 next Wednesday. There's also going to be something pretty big for next
Thursday's regularly scheduled playlist.
