#### More on Words Are Useless

Originally released 2nd of December, 2013 under And All That Were Left Were
Monsters.

A collection of electronic sounds created over a couple of years in the early
2010s, later revisited for mixing and mastering in 2013. A few rules were laid
out at the beginning; the standard "verse-chorus-verse" structure should be
avoided at all costs. Work on one composition at a time, once you've moved onto
a new composition you cannot go back to work on past compositions. When a
composition is being worked on over multiple sessions, you cannot delete any
piece that was previously saved, though you can rearrange. NO LIVE INSTRUMENTS.
Compositions are to be sequenced in the order they were written.

> all sounds created, engineered, mixed and mastered by TJ Webb  
all sounds created electronically, recorded between 2010 and 2013  
these are not songs, this is not an album  
do with this as you will; listen, share, sample, remix, ignore
