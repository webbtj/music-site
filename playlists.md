## Summer of TJ™ - Volume 4a & 4b: Chris Cornell & Chester Bennington (27th of July, 2017)
>Here at the Summer of TJ™ I like to have fun with music, and visuals and art.
But sometimes it's not all fun and games and sometimes reality kicks you in the
ass. I'd been planning a Chris Cornell playlist given that we lost him recently.
In the wake of Chester Bennington's passing there were just too many reasons to
cover both of these amazing voices.  <br><br>
Their relationship is well documented, Chester sang Hallelujah at Chris'
funeral, Chester passed away on Chris' birthday. These two were great friends
and without a doubt two of the greatest rock voices I have ever heard. These
are two of my favourite singers of all time, both taken from the world far, far
too soon.

Part of the Summer of TJ™ series 2017. Volumes 4a & 4b: Chris Cornell & Chester
Bennington. I'd been planning a Chris Cornell list since we lost him earlier
this year. After last week I decided to do two this week; Chris Cornell &
Chester Bennington. Keep up with the Summer of TJ™ on Twitter

I wouldn't be who I am as an artist without any of these tracks. It's a mixed

musically but are some of my favourite get the f up jams. Keep up with the
