### Original Post
I am insanely elated to finally announce the release of my debut solo EP under my own name! Logic & Guns will be released digitally beginning June 3rd. The EP will also be available on CD in a 6-panel digipak with visuals by Justin Bellefontaine, shipping out in early August. Logic & Guns will be rolling out to all of your favourite digital outlets like iTunes, Spotify, Google Play and more over the month of June. Both the digital and CD versions of the EP are available for pre-order now on Bandcamp, pre-orders give you instant download and streaming access to the lead single, Country Girl. Keep an eye on webb.tj, Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram for updates on releases to various digital platforms.

I’m so pleased with the outcome of this process which was all very new to me. I was granted the opportunity of working with consummate professionals and real facilities like New Scotland Yard and Archive Mastering.

This is my first solo offering under my own name. After years of playing in rock bands, remixing under various monikers, and a handful of releases under the And All That Were Left Were Monsters project, I’m finally offering up works that reflect me as an individual. Politically charged, socially aware, ever confused and as sarcastic as you’d expect, Logic & Guns cares not for genre rules and regulations borrowing from industrial, rock, hip-hop, and electronic music to make something familiarly new. Droney. Loud. Quite. Complex. Simple. Logic & Guns.
