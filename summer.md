The Summer of TJ™ is in full swing following the first two announcements of a
summer rerelease series as well as a summer curated playlist series. And rumour
has it, that's not all that's in store for the summer.

## Summer Rerelease Series
Throughout July and August, all four And All That Were Left Were Monsters albums
and EPs are being released and made available for the first time ever on iTunes,
Spotify, Google Play Music, Amazon, Tidal and basically every other streaming
service out there.

And All That Were Left Were Monsters was TJ's previous solo project, very much
indie-industrial-electronic-experimental-rock. Or something.

The series begins 7 July with Words Are Useless - an instrumental, experimental,
electronic, 100% "in-the-box" album originally released in 2013, with origins
dating back to 2010.

Next is 21 July's Volume One - the debut EP from AATWLWM featuring the tracks
God Complex and This One's Gonna Hurt. Originally released in 2013.

August begins with God Complex on 4 August - the first single from the Volume
One EP is really more of an EP in its own right with the original track, three
remixes and a non-album instrumental track. Originally released in 2013.

The series ends on 18 August with This One's Gonna Hurt - the second single from
Volume One and again, it's really more of an EP itself given that it includes
the single mix along with five different remixes. Originally released in 2014.

## Summer Playlist Series
Every Thursday, all summer, I'll be providing a curated playlist straight to
your ear bones. Playlists are coming at you via Google Play Music and Spotify.
