### ABOUT:
The kind of music dead people dance to. Haunting synths, droning, fuzzed out guitars, beats ‘n’ bass. TJ Webb is bringing you electronic infused rock and industrial sounds for less than the price of a cup of coffee a day.

After years of playing in garage rock bands in rural Nova Scotia, remixing for artists around the globe, and some moderate success with his And All That Were Left Were Monsters solo project, TJ’s dropped the pseudonyms and honed his creative energy into a laser beam pointing square at a new sound that is a direct reflection of himself. A sonic wall that still lets nuances and subtleties through, it’s not guitar music, it’s not dance music, it’s something else. Borrowing elements from genres such as industrial, rock, hip-hop and electronic music but also discarding genre rules, TJ’s sound is familiar yet different.

A true reflection of the human known as TJ Webb, the sounds are politically charged, socially aware, ever confused and as sarcastic as you would expect. Pumping sounds out of his Secret Hideout studio hidden in the woods outside Halifax, NS, TJ’s first solo effort, Logic & Guns is available now digitally and on CD later this summer.
